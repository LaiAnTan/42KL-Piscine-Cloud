**Scalability** is to design architecture to **automatically respond to changing demand** by scaling out or in.

EC2 Auto Scaling **automatically adds / removes** [[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)|EC2 instances]] in response to changing application demand.

There are two approaches to EC2 Auto Scaling:

#### Dynamic Scaling
Scales **as a response** to an increase in demand

#### Predictive Scaling
Scales **preemptively** based on **predicted** demand

### Configuring Auto Scaling
The minimum, desired and maximum EC2 instances can be set beforehand.
