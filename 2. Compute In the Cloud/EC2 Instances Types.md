There are five different types of [[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)|EC2 Instances]]:

### General Purpose Instances
Provides a **balance** of compute, memory and networking resources

### Compute Optimised Instances
Specialises for **compute - intensive** tasks (tasks that benefit from high - performance CPUs)

### Memory Optimised Instances
Specialises for **memory - intensive** tasks (tasks that benefit from larger memory capacity, i.e. RAM)

### Accelerated Computing Instances
Uses hardware accelerators (GPUs) to speed up data processing

### Storage Optimised Instances
Specialises in **data - intensive** tasks (tasks that require high read / write to large datasets on local storage)
