**Serverless Computing** refers to running code on a server **without having to manage** the actual server itself.

A benefit of serverless computing is that it is flexible, i.e. it can be scale automatically.

There are many AWS services that are serverless, such as:
- [[AWS Lambda]]
- [[AWS Fargate]]
- [[Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)]]
- [[Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)]]
- [[Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)]]
- [[Amazon DynamoDB]]
- [[AWS Glue]]
