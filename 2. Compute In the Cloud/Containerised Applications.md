Containers are a standard way to package code and dependencies into a single object.

- Used for processes and workflows

Some programs that manage containers include **Docker** and **Kubernetes**.

Similarly, Amazon also has services that help to manage these containers, namely [[Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)]] and [[Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)]].
