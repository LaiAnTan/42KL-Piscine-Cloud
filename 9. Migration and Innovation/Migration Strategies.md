There are six common strategies for cloud migration, called the six R's:

### Rehosting
Also known as **lift - and - shift**, rehosting involves moving applications without changes.

### Replatforming
Replatforming involves making a few cloud optimisations to realise a tangible benefit, also known as **lift, tinker and shift**.

### Refactoring
Refactoring involves reimagining how an application is architected and developed by using cloud - native features.

Refactoring involves the highest initial costs.

### Retaining
Retaining involves only **migrating applications that are necessary**, and keeping applications that are critical on the source environment.

### Retiring
Retiring means to **depreciate (remove) features / applications that are / will be irrelevant**.
