#service #module_6

A web application firewall that lets customers monitor network requests that enter web applications.

AWS WAF works together with [[Amazon CloudFront]] and an Application Load Balancer.

It uses a **web access control list** (ACL, similar to [[Network Access Control List (ACL)]]) to block or allow traffic.
