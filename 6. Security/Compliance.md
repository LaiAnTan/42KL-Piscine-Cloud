Compliance refers to the state of being in accordance with established standards / guidelines.

In every industry, there will be specific standards that need to be upheld, and inspections / auditing will occur to make sure those standards are up to par.

Therefore, a business needs to make sure it is in compliance with specific standards the business is held to.

AWS has tools to assist with compliance and auditing, namely:
- [[AWS Artifact]]
- [[Customer Compliance Center]]
