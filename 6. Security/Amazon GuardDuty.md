#service #module_6

A service that provides **intelligent threat detection** for AWS infrastructure and resources.

Amazon GuardDuty continuously monitors the network activity and account behaviour to identify threats.

Detected threats can be reviewed in the [[Ways to interact with AWS Services#AWS Management Console|AWS Management Console]], or [[AWS Lambda]] functions can be configured to take remediation steps automatically as a response.
