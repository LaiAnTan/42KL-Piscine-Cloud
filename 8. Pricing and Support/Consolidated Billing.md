Consolidated Billing is a feature for [[AWS Organisations]] where only a **single bill** is received for all the accounts in the organisation.

This is because it is **more convenient** to pay for a single bill than one bill for each account in the organisation.

Other benefits include:
- The bill shows **itemised charges** incurred by each account, which enables **transparency** into said organisation's accounts while maintaining convenience.
- Ability to share bulk discount pricing, savings plans and reserved instances across all accounts in the organisation, saving costs.
