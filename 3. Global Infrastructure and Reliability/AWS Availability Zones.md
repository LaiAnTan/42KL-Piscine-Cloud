An **Availability Zone** consists of **one or more data centres** that are located **far apart** from each other.

This is close enough to have low latency between zones, but far apart enough that if a disaster occurs in one part of the Region, it reduces the chance that multiple Availability Zones are affected.

Each [[AWS Regions|Region]] consists of at least **three Availability Zones**.

It is considered best practice to run across at least **two availability zones**.
