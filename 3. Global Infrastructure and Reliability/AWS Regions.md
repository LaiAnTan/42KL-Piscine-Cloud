AWS builds their data centres in groups called **Regions**.

Regions are locations closest to where the business traffic demands.

Each Region is isolated from every other Region, i.e. no data goes in / out of an environment in a Region.

When selecting a Region for an AWS Service, there are four factors that must be considered:

1. Compliance with data governance and legal requirements
2. Proximity to customers (the closer the better)
3. Available services within a Region (some regions have different services)
4. Pricing (some regions are more difficult to host from, i.e. Brazil)

Within each Region, there exists [[AWS Availability Zones|Availability Zones]].
