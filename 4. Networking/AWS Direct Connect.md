#service #module_4

A service that establishes a **dedicated private connection** between a data centre and a [[Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)]].

This can reduce network costs and increase bandwidth of the network, as the only network traffic is the traffic to and from the VPC, not to anywhere else (i.e. like a private road)
