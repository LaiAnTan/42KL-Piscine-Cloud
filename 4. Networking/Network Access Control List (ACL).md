A network Access Control List (ACL) is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic at the **[[Subnets|subnet level]]**.

It has a list of **rules** that determine whether a packet is allowed / denied.

A network ACL is **stateless**, which means that it has **no memory**, and thus checks all packets that cross the border (i.e. subnet)

By default, a network ACL **allows all inbound and outbound traffic**.
