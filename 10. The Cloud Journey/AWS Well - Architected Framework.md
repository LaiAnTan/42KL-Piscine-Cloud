The AWS Well - Architected Framework helps customers understand how to design and operate reliable, secure, efficient and cost - effective systems on the AWS cloud.

It is based on six pillars:

### Operational Excellence
The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.

### Security
The ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

### Reliability
The ability of a system to:

- Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions
- Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
- Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues

### Performance Efficiency
The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technology evolves.

### Cost Optimisation
The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.

### Sustainability
The ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximising the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimising the total resources required.
